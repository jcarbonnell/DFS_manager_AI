# Decentralized File Storage Manager AI Agent

An AI agent designed for managing decentralized file storage systems, with a focus on IPFS integration. It automates the analysis, tagging, indexing, organization and optimization of file storage, enhances data retrieval efficiency, and ensures privacy and security in a decentralized environment.

### Next Steps:
- ~~start with [NEAR AI](https://docs.near.ai/agents/quickstart/)~~
- add functionality to the agent.
